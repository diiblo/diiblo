# 👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## 🚀 About Me

I'm King Rahman Moctarr Basiru, currently pursuing a Mastère in Data Engineering at ECE Paris. With a background in software development (C#, PHP, Blazor, MAUI), I'm now focusing on **data engineering**, **cloud technologies**, and **AI/ML**. Passionate about "learning by doing", I build end-to-end projects to simulate real-world data pipelines, cloud architectures, and intelligent systems.

## 💡 What I’m Working On

- Building full data pipelines (ingestion → processing → analysis) using **Docker**, **Spark**, **Airflow**, and **MinIO**
- Creating data apps and dashboards with **Power BI**, **Python**, and **SQL**
- Learning and applying **Machine Learning** for prediction and classification tasks
- Experimenting with **Generative AI** and **LLMs** for building smart agents
- Developing apps with **.NET Blazor** and **MAUI** to integrate AI into web/desktop experiences

## 🧠 Skills

### Data & Analytics
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
- SQL / BigQuery
- Apache Spark
- Power BI
- Airflow
- Delta Lake / Parquet

### Cloud & Tools
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git & GitHub

### Development
- C# (Blazor, WinForms, MAUI, ASP.NET)
- PHP (Laravel)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## 🎯 Objective

To grow as a **Data Engineer** and contribute to **impactful projects** involving big data, AI, and cloud technologies. I'm actively seeking a **12-month work-study opportunity (alternance)** starting in **September 2025** to apply my skills in a professional environment and keep learning from real-world challenges.

## 🤝 Let’s Collaborate

I'm open to:
- Data or AI-related project collaborations
